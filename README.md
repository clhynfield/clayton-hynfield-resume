# Résumé

A web résumé you can easily publish to GitHub Pages

## Quick Start

  1. Open `app/index.html` and fill in your own personal
     information, work experience, education, and skills.
  2. Open `app/styles/personal.less` and tweak the colors
     and fonts to suit your personal style.
  3. Preview and publish the content in `app`. More on that
     below.

## Development

### Develop static content locally

I developed most of the static content and styling on an iPad Pro,
and it remains a goal of this project to enable quick and easy
content development on simple, post-PC devices.

You'll find all the content and styling in `app`, and it should
render all client-side just fine from there.

### Develop and build with Gulp

For a full developer workflow, including live-reloading preview,
and stylesheet preprocessing and optimization, you'll need to
install [Node], [Gulp], and [Bower].
